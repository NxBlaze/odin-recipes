            <h2>Description</h2>
            <p>Delicious, creamy risotto, which you can prepare in under 30 minutes.</p>

            <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>250g arborio rice</li>
                <li>350ml vegetable or chicken stock</li>
                <li>400g fresh cherry tomatoes</li>
                <li>40g butter</li>
                <li>1 tbsp olive oil</li>
                <li>250g mascarpone cheese</li>
                <li>Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese - for dressing</li>
                <li>Fresh basil - for dressing</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Put the chicken stock on a small fire to keep it hot.</li>
                <li>In a separate pot, melt the butter and add tomatoes, chopped in half. Keep the pot covered, on a
                    medium-low
                    fire and occasionally stir. If you like, add a pinch of oregano.</li>
                <li>On a large pan, warm up the olive oil, then add rice. Mix throughly.</li>
                <li>Add stock to the rice, about 50ml (or one small ladle) at a time. Wait for rice to absorb the stock
                    before
                    adding more. Keep stirring. This should take roughly 15-20min.</li>
                <li>Once all the stock is absorbed, fold in the mascarpone cheese and the tomatoes, which by now should
                    have
                    turned into a pulp. For a more creamy texture, you can force tomatoes through a sieve, to filter out
                    the
                    seeds. It takes a while though, so make sure to stir the pan in the meantime. Add a little freshly
                    ground
                    pepper if you like. Mix everything throughly.</li>
                <li>Serve with a sprinkle of finely ground Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese and fresh basil.</li>
            </ol>
